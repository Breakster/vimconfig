Neovim and vim8 configuration and plugins.

Clone this repo in your ~/.config/nvim directory. If you need this to work with vim8 as well, don't forget to also add this to your .vimrc:
```viml
source ~/.config/nvim/init.vim
```

If this is the first time you checkout the repo, also init submodules by doing:
```bash
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
